            <h3 class="heading">Verse 1</h3>
            <p>As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
                I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
                'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
                Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
                But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
                Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
                You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
                Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
                I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
                As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
                I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
                On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight
            </p>

            <p class="chorus">We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
                We've been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
                We keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

            <h3 class="heading">Verse 2</h3>
            <p>Look at the situation they got me facin'
                I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
                So I gotta be down with the hood team
                Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
                I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
                Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
                I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
                And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
                Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
                I'm livin' life do-or-die, what can I say?
                I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
                The way things is goin', I don't know</p>

            <h3 class="heading">Verse 3: Coolio</h3>
            <p>Power and the money, money and the power
                Minute after minute, hour after hour
                Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
                It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
                They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
                If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
                I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
                That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool</p>
